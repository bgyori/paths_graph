Paths Graph documentation
=========================

The Paths Graph (PG), and its derivative the Cycle-Free Paths Graph (CFPG),
represent a set of paths of interest without explicitly enumerating them.
Using the PG and CFPG, queries concerning a set of paths can be answered by
performing graphical operations on the rather than on the underlying
directed network.
